GRADLE VERSION 7.4

ANDROID GRADLE PLUGIN VERSION Android Gradle Plugin version 7.3.1

Using Transform API

WARNING:API 'android.registerTransform' is obsolete.




It will be removed in version 8.0 of the Android Gradle plugin.




The Transform API is removed to improve build performance. Projects that use the




Transform API force the Android Gradle plugin to use a less optimized flow for the




build that can result in large regressions in build times. It’s also difficult to




use the Transform API and combine it with other Gradle features; the replacement




APIs aim to make it easier to extend the build without introducing performance or




correctness issues.







There is no single replacement for the Transform API—there are new, targeted




APIs for each use case. All the replacement APIs are in the




`androidComponents {}` block.







The Transform API uses incremental APIs deprecated since Gradle 7.5. Please add




`android.experimental.legacyTransform.forceNonIncremental=true` to




`gradle.properties` to fix this issue. Note that this will run transforms




non-incrementally and may have a build performance impact.




For more information, see https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin-api-updates#transform-api.




To determine what is calling android.registerTransform, use -Pandroid.debug.obsoleteApi=true on the command line to display more information.

D:\AV_Messenger-master\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:5:5-44 Warning:




	uses-sdk:minSdkVersion value (21) specified in the manifest file is ignored. It is overridden by the value declared in the DSL or the variant API, or 1 if not declared/present. Current value is (16).

D:\AV_Messenger-master\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:5:5-44 Error:




	uses-sdk:minSdkVersion 16 cannot be smaller than version 21 declared in library [com.productscience.transformer:transformer-module:0.18.4] C:\Users\Admin\.gradle\caches\transforms-3\c071b61398cc663fd657b38842787959\transformed\transformer-module-0.18.4\AndroidManifest.xml as the library might be using APIs not available in 16




	Suggestion: use a compatible library with a minSdk of at most 16,




		or increase this project's minSdk version to at least 21,




		or use tools:overrideLibrary="com.productscience.transformer.module" to force usage (may lead to runtime failures)
